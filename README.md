# Time_series_analysis_for_Bitcoin_price_and_PredictionðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

Time series analysis is a statistical method that uses historical data to predict future values. It can be used to analyze the price of Bitcoin, as well as other financial assets.

There are a number of different time series analysis techniques that can be used to predict Bitcoin prices but I used ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) model.
The choice of which time series analysis technique to use for Bitcoin price prediction depends on a number of factors, including the amount of historical data available, the desired level of accuracy, and the computational resources available.Accuracy of my model is 97%.
